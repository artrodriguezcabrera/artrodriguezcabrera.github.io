I have decided to create a GitHub Page.  I intend to use this site to document all the amazing things that a developer encounters.  At the moment, I am very interested in learning about React Native and .NET Core Framework.  They are on completely different sides of the spectrum.  One is a skill I have to pick up for work.  The other one is something I have been very intersted in learning for a couple of years.  

I work for [minds + assembly][mna] as a lead developer in New York.  We work on a lot of different projects which allow me to touch many new technologies.  I also ensure to guide our teams in the best solutions and technologies we can provide to our clients.
