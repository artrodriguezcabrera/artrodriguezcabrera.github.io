I intend to use this site to document all the amazing things that a developer encounters.  At the moment, I am very interested in learning about React Native and .NET Core Framework.

I also ensure to guide our teams in the best solutions and technologies we can provide to our clients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I have decided to create a GitHub Page.
